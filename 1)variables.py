#Q1) Create a variable called break and assign it a value 5. See what happens and find out the reason behind the behavior that you see.

breakjji = 5
print(breakjji)

#since break is a keyword we know that it will show an error

#Q2)Create two variables. One to store your birth year and another one to store current year. Now calculate your age using these two variables

birth_year =  2001
current_year = 2024
print( current_year - birth_year)

#Q3) Store your first, middle and last name in three different variables and then print your full name using these variables

first_name = 'Gullinkala'
middle_name = 'Sai'
last_name = 'Jyotiraditya'
print ( first_name + ' ' + middle_name + ' ' +last_name)

#Q4) Answer which of these are invalid variable names: _nation 1record record1 record_one record-one record^one continue
#A4) continue cause it is a keyword, 1record cause it cannot be starting with an number, record-one, and record^one cause they literally do not make any sense.
